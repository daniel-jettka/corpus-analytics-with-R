# Simple corpus analytics with R
Reading and analyzing linguistic corpora with R

The starting point of this project was the attempt to read XML-encoded corpora directly from an online catalogue (Virtual Language Observatory - https://vlo.clarin.eu) where the corpora are indexed via standard metadata (CMDI).

The package requires the installation of the package xml2 (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xml2/readme/README.html), e.g. from CRAN:
install.packages("xml2")
